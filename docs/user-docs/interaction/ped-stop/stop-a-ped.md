# Stop a ped

Stopping a ped is very simple to do, similar to STP.
In order to do that you just walk up to a ped and press your defined interaction key (default:
`T` on keyboard). A blip should appear on the ped, and they should stop whatever they are doing.

Pressing your interaction key again should now bring up the **Ped Stop Menu**.
