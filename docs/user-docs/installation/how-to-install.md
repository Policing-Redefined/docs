# How to install

Installing PR is fairly simple: just like any other LSPDFR plugin.

Upon downloading PR you will get a `Policing Redefined v[VERSION].zip` archive
containing all files that are required to run the plugin. Simply extract the content of it
and drag-and-drop the content of the `GTAV MAIN DIRECTORY` folder into your
**GTA 5 root directory**.

:::danger Requirements
You also need to download and install (if not already):
- [DamageTrackerFramework by Vari](https://www.lcpdfr.com/downloads/gta5mods/scripts/42767-damage-tracker-framework/)
- RAGENativeUI by AlexGuirre
:::

In your `plugins/LSPDFR` directory there should be files and folders related to 
`PolicingRedefined` and [`CommonDataFramework`](https://github.com/Policing-Redefined/CommonDataFramework),
where the latter is another system developed by us that PR uses in order to create, modify and store
pedestrian and vehicle document data.\
*If you are a developer you can read about it [here](/docs/developer-docs/cdf/what-is-it.md).*

:::tip
You will notice that the `Settings/` folder is empty but that is not something to worry about!
PR will generate all `.ini` files automatically once you run it for the first time.
