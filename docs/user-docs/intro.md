# Getting Started

**Policing Redefined** is a [LSPDFR](https://lcpdfr.com) plugin similar to popular
plugins such as **Stop The Ped**, **Ultimate Backup** by Bejoijo or **LSPDFR+**, 
**Arrest-Manager** by Albo1125.

It aims to provide an even more feature-rich and immersive experience to your
LSPDFR Patrol, advancing ped and traffic stops as well as adding additional
vehicle stops and on-foot traffic stops. And that is just a small portion of what
**PR** (Policing Redefined) has to offer!

**This guide** will hopefully help you switch to PR (almost) seamlessly while
explaining all it's interaction and backup systems.

If you are ready to explore the new world of features, see you in the **next** step! :)
