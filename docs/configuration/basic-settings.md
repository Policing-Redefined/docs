# Basic settings

The very basic settings can be adjusted through the `.ini` files in the `Settings/` folder.\
*If you are missing those, you should probably go back to [First launch](/docs/installation/first-launch).*

As of writing this, the folder should contain four files:
- `InteractionSettings.ini`: Controls everything non-backup.
- `BackupSettings.ini`: Controls backup settings.
- `LocalizationSettings.ini`: Controls UI translation, by default **English**.
- `PropSettings.ini`: Controls prop models, offsets and rotations.

We will not go into detail for those as every setting has a description which explains
what it does and what value to input. The value that is already set (if you haven't changed it yet) is
the default value.
