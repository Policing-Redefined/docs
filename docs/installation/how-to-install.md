# How to install

Installing PR is fairly simple: just like any other LSPDFR plugin.

Upon downloading PR you will get a `Policing Redefined v[VERSION].zip` archive
containing all files that are required to run the plugin. Simply extract the content of it
and drag-and-drop it into your **GTA 5 root directory**.

In your `plugins/LSPDFR` directory there should be files and folders related to 
`PolicingRedefined` and [`CommonDataFramework`](https://github.com/Policing-Redefined/CommonDataFramework),
where the latter is another system developed by us that PR uses in order to create, modify and store
pedestrian and vehicle document data.\
*If you are a developer you can read about it [here].*

You will notice that the `Settings/` folder is empty but that is not something to worry about!
PR will generate all `.ini` files automatically once you run it for the first time.
